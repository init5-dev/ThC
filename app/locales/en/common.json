      "Theravada Cuba was born from the union of a group of people who, inspired by the teachings of the Buddha, gathered at the 'Monte Barreto' Ecological Park in 2019. Since then, we have grown and established ourselves as a Theravada community in Cuba, dedicated to meditation and the study of the Dhamma.",
      "Our community is a spiritual family that practices mindfulness and cultivates compassion. We strive to maintain the authenticity of our teachings, guided by the wisdom of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. Over the years, we have organized significant events, such as the Pan-Buddhist Vesak 2023 gathering and the Athangika Sila at the Sri Lankan embassy.",
      "Every member of Theravada Cuba is committed to personal and collective development, always seeking to deepen their understanding of the Dhamma. Our goal is to continue growing and evolving, creating an inclusive space for all those who seek a path to spiritual liberation.",
      "We are proud to be a living and vibrant community, open to reflection and continuous learning. We invite everyone to join us on this path of wisdom and transformation."
